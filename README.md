# Selectize 

[Selectize](http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/) is the hybrid of a textbox and `<select>` element. It's a jQuery-based plugin that can be used for tagging, contact lists, country selectors, and lots more.

## Install

`meteor add nicolasmccurdy:meteor-selectize-unstyled`

This Meteor package loads the plugin without any styles. Just add to your app and set it up manually as you would in any other application.
